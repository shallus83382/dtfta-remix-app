            colors or product appearance may differ from how they may appear on

            TRANSFER AUTHORITY confirms acceptance. We must receive and process
            your payment before your order is accepted. Please review your order
            carefully before submitting, as DTF TRANSFER AUTHORITY may be unable to
            accommodate cancellation requests after an order is accepted. In the
            event that we do not accept, make a change to, or cancel an order, we

            &quot;Agent/[agent name]&quot;; (ii) not conceal or obfuscate that any
            access, use, or interactions are from an Agent, such as by (a) mimicking
            human behavior and interaction patterns, or (b) completing or
            circumventing CAPTCHAs or measures intended to distinguish computer use
            from humans, (iii) respond truthfully to any question or prompt seeking
            to determine if interactions are coming from a human or a computer, (iv)
